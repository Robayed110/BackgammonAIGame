# ðŸŽ² Python Backgammon Game(AI)

Welcome to the Python Backgammon Game! This is a simplified version of the classic Backgammon board game, implemented using Python. The game is divided into two main components:

- **BGMN.py** â€“ Handles all core game logic (dice rolls, rules, checker movements)
- **GUI.py** â€“ Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the game

You must **run the game from `GUI.py`** to start playing.
