# 🎲 Python Backgammon Game

Welcome to the Python Backgammon Game! This is a simplified version of the classic Backgammon board game, implemented using Python. The game is divided into two main components:

- **BGMN.py** – Handles all core game logic (dice rolls, rules, checker movements)
- **GUI.py** – Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the game

You must **run the game from `GUI.py`** to start playing.
